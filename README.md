# Marketplace_Implementation
This project was my 3rd Homework for the course CMPE 160 (Introduction to Object Oriented Programming) at Bogazici University.
## About the Project
In this project I have implemented a simple marketplace mechanism mainly using PriorityQueue class, Comparable interface and the object oriented paradigm. Although the rules stated in the description relatively simple compared to real life, the project was very instructive in terms of learning to use PriorityQueue class, Comparable interface and to enhance my ability to follow object oriented programming principles.
## To Run the Code
First compile using:
```javac CMPE160_HW3_volcaniqueo/src/executable/*.java CMPE160_HW3_volcaniqueo/src/elements/*.java -d CMPE160_HW3_volcaniqueo/bin```

Then move onto bin:
```cd CMPE160_HW3_volcaniqueo/bin```

Finally run using arguments:
```java executable/Main <input_file> <output_file>```
